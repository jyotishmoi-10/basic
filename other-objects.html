            <h2>Moon</h2>
            <img src="http://www.seasky.org/celestial-objects/assets/images/moon1.jpg" height="500px" width="100px" alt="Mercury">
            <p>The Moon has always been a source of awe and wonder for mankind. It has been worshiped and feared, and it has inspired both lovers and writers. Our Moon is the only alien world that can be seen with the naked eye. Men have walked on its surface. But what exactly is the Moon and where did it come from? A moon is defined as an object that orbits a planet. It is the planet's natural satellite. And when it comes to satellites, the Earth is not alone. Most of the other planets in our solar system also have moons. The number of moons ranges from one for the Earth, to as many as 21 for Uranus. Two of our planets, Mercury and Venus, have no moons. Jupiter has 16 known moons, Saturn has 18, and Neptune has 8. Pluto has one moon, but this moon is so large in comparison that many astronomers consider the two objects to be a double planet rather than a planet and a moon. Moons also vary greatly in size. The smallest is Mars' moon Deimos with a diameter of about 10 miles (11 km). The largest moon in the Solar System is Jupiter's moon Ganymede with a diameter of 3280 miles (5262 km). This makes Ganymede larger than the planet Mercury. By comparison, the Earth's moon is 2160 miles (3476 km) in diameter. All moons orbit their host planets as well as rotating about their own axis. Our moon takes a little over 27 days to make one complete orbit of the Earth. Some moons, including our own, orbit in what is called a synchronous rotation. In this case, the time it takes the Moon to make one orbit of the planet is the same as the time it takes the Moon to make one complete rotation on its axis. This means that the Moon always keeps the same face towards the planet.</p>
            <h2>Asteroids & Comets</h2>

            <h3>Cosmic Leftovers</h3>
            <p>Asteroids and comets are the leftovers from the formation of our Solar System. When we think of the Solar System, we tend to think of the Sun, its eight planets, and their moons. But there is much more going on here than meets the eye. The empty spaces of our solar system are littered with small objects known as asteroids and comets. These objects can be thought of as the leftovers of the Solar System. There are chunks of rock, ice, or both that are believed to have formed from the primordial matter that originally created the Solar System. Comets have been known since ancient times. This is because they tend to announce their arrival in grand style. As the Sun heats their cores, their long, glowing tails can be seen for weeks as the circle the Sun. These objects were once thought to be omens of disaster. Several comets return like clockwork on a cycle that brings them back every few years. Comet Halley, perhaps the most famous, returns every 76 years. Unlike comets, asteroids tend to come and go unnoticed. They are usually only seen when they enter the Earth's atmosphere. A few of the asteroids in our solar system are large enough to be observed from Earth. The first to be observed was Ceres. It was discovered by a Sicilian monk named Giuseppe Piazzi in 1801. Since that time, thousands of these objects have been discovered.</p>
            <h2>Nebulae</h2>
            <img src="http://www.seasky.org/celestial-objects/assets/images/nebula2.jpg" height="500px" width="100px" alt="Mercury">
            <p>The word "nebula" is derived from the Latin word for "clouds". Indeed, a nebula is a cosmic cloud of gas and dust floating in space. More than one nebula are called nebulae. Nebulae are the basic building blocks of the universe. They contain the elements from which stars and solar systems are built. They are also among the most beautiful objects in the universe, glowing with rich colors and swirls of light. Stars inside these clouds of gas cause them to glow with beautiful reds, blues, and greens. These colors are the result of different elements within the nebula. Most nebulae are composed of about 90% hydrogen, 10% helium, and 0.1% heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, magnesium, potassium, calcium, iron. These clouds of matter are also quite large. In fact, they are among the largest objects in the galaxy. Many of them are dozens or even hundreds of light-years across. Nebulae have been divided into five major categories. These are emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, dark nebulae, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants. Emission and reflection nebulae tend to be fuzzy in appearance and lack any noticeable shape or structure. They are also known as diffuse nebulae.</p>
